# Better Babies

## Overview
A mod for Lethal Company that makes the babies (maneater) better.

## Features
This mod provides the following features:

- Allow the baby to go outside without crying
- Allow the baby to be taken into orbit
- Allow the baby to be sold at the company


## Instructions

While you can still join others clients that do not have the mod it WILL (maybe) cause desyncs.

Before taking off (and pulling lever) you must drop the baby and pick it back after pulling.

Make sure the baby is pocketed when landing (unexpected behaviour expected if its on the ground)

Dropping the baby while in landing/taking off will lead to the baby noclipping and being lost (or transforming).

It is recemended to put the baby on the Company deposit counter as soon as you land. (if you intend to sell it)

Baby sell price is configurable.

It is not recemended to make the baby cry while in orbit as it may cause issues.
